=======

Swirly Cloud is a Fintech startup that aims to deliver the benefits of Cloud computing to the
financial industry. Our systems have been built from the ground-up to run efficiently in the Cloud
with limited resources. They draw on the lessons learned from years spent building front-office
trading applications, and adapt their best ideas for the Cloud. The order-book at the heart of our
trading application was developed using best practice from the HFT space to achieve microsecond
latencies.

We provide bespoke software development and consultancy services to clients in the financial
sector. We specialise in building high-performance electronic trading applications. Our development
and consultancy services include analysis, design, implementation and testing.

Swirly Cloud Limited is registered company in England and Wales.
