with limited resources. They draw on the lessons learned from years spent building front-office
trading applications, and adapt their best ideas for the Cloud. The order-book at the heart of our
trading application was developed using best practice from the HFT space to achieve microsecond

History
-------

Swirly Cloud started life in 2013 as a set of open-source libraries written in C11. The project was
originally called, Doobry. These libraries are still available in the
[GitHub repository](http://github.com/swirlycloud/swirly/tree/0.1.0).

In the summer of 2014, the decision was made to port these libraries to Java, so that they could run
on [Google's Cloud platform](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/). Powerful Java tooling helped
improve the design and further accelerate evolution. A modern Web interface was added and a number
of technology previews were [released on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/SwirlyCloudDotCom) at
this time.

On December 16th, 2014, Swirly Cloud Limited was formed and copyright ownership transferred to the
company.

New features were added to the Java port in 2015, including support for:
- A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) backend;
- A [Memcachd](http://memcached.org/) caching layer;
- An improved [Restful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer);
- A [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) user interface;
- Improved efficiency and horizontal scalability;
- Several architectural and technical improvements.

In December, 2015, a [retail quoting engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ladmmNt7Bo8) was added
to the platform, and work began on backporting the core Java libraries to C++14.
