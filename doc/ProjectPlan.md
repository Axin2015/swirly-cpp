### Why ###

Investment banks and other financial institutions often build in-house matching engines to
facilitate trading between desks, to reduce the cost of trading on external venues.

Matching engines tend to follow a pre-defined set of rules and present mostly technical
challenges. Open-sourcing the mechanical parts of a trading platform allows the business to focus on
IP-sensitive pricing and trading algorithms.
