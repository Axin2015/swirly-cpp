Matching-engines are used in financial trading systems to match buyers and sellers in a
market-place. Market-makers place bids and offers into a central limit order-book. Market-makers can
revise or cancel these "resting" orders. Orders in the order-book are aggregated into price-levels
and presented to market participants as market-data. A trade happens when an order crosses the
spread and matches with an existing bid or offer.
