The Cloud {#Cloud}

Cloud Platforms
---------------

Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon (GAFA) have built highly-scalable platforms capable of handling
over [one billion users per day](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34082393). They are now
providing access to their global compute infrastructure as a managed service (the Cloud). The
landscape of modern software development has fundamentally changed as a consequence. We believe that
the world of finance can benefit tremendously from these innovations.

The beauty of Cloud computing is that we only pay for what we use, so we don't need to invest our
capital on infrastructure and capacity for future growth. The Cloud also simplifies maintenance,
operations, disaster recovery and security, so that we can focus our efforts on writing great
software.
