Overview
========

Matching engines are used in financial trading systems to match buyers and sellers in a
market-place. Traders place bids and offers into an order-book. These orders can be revised and
cancelled. A trade happens when a bid and offer match on price. Market participants can see the
liquidity currently available in the order-book.

Doobry is an open-source matching engine written in C11. The target platform is GNU/Linux. The
source-code is [freely available on GitHub](http://github.com/doobry-org). See
[related pages](http://www.doobry.org/pages.html) for more information.
