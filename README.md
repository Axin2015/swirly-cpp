What is Twirly?
---------------

Twirly is an open-source matching engine written in C11. The target platform is GNU/Linux. The
source-code is [freely available on GitHub](http://github.com/swirlycloud).

Matching engines are used in financial trading systems to match buyers and sellers in a
market-place. Traders place bids and offers into a central order-book. These orders can be revised
and cancelled. A trade happens when a bid and offer match on price. Market participants can see the
liquidity currently available in the order-book.
