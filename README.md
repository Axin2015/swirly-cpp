================

Matching engines are used in financial trading systems to match buyers and sellers in a
market-place.

Investment banks and other financial organisations often build in-house matching engines to
facilitate trading between desks and reduce the cost of trading on external venues.

Matching engines tend to follow a pre-defined set of rules and present mostly technical
challenges. Open-sourcing the mechanical parts of a trading platform allows the business to focus on
IP-sensitive pricing and trading algorithms.

Doobry is an open-source matching engine written in C11. The target platform is GNU/Linux. The
source-code is [freely available on GitHub](http://github.com/doobry-org).
