/**

 *
 * This project provides the core components for an open-source matching engine.
 *
 * Matching engines are used in financial trading systems to match buyers and sellers in a
 * market-place.
 *
 * Investment banks and other financial organisations often build in-house matching engines to
 * facilitate trading between desks and reduce the cost of trading on external venues.
 *
 * Matching engines tend to follow a pre-defined set of rules and present mostly technical
 * challenges. Open-sourcing the technical parts of a trading platform allows businesses to focus on
 * their IP-sensitive pricing and trading algorithms.
 *
 * The goal of this project is to eventually host an educational trading platform that will allow
 * market-participants to experiment and compete in a risk-free environment.
 *
 * The core libraries are written in C11, which are supplemented with C++11 wrappers for
 * convenience.
 *
 * The matching engine currently favours performance over a rich feature set.
